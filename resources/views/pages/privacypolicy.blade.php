            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is BGD Tech's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any
                applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including
                across our website, https://www.bgdtech.uk, and other sites we own and operate. </p>
            <p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes
                information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment
                details, and even information about how you use a website or online service. </p>
            <p>In the event our site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites
                and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you
                should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information.
                This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our site. </p>
            <p>This policy is effective as of 24 January 2022. </p>
            <p>Last updated: 24 January 2022 </p>
            <h3 style="color:rgb(141, 3, 3);">Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: One is “voluntarily provided” information and
               another one is “automatically collected” information. </p>
            <p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when
                using or participating in any of our services and promotions. </p>
            <p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your devices in the
                course of accessing our products and services. </p>
            <h3 style="color:rgb(141, 3, 3);">Collection and Use of Information</h3>
            <p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our website: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content</li>
                <li>Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies</li>
                <li>When you mention us on social media</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general
                information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, Our marketing and
                market research activities may uncover data and insights, which we may combine with information about
                how visitors use our site to improve our site and your experience on it. </p>
            <h3 style="color:rgb(141, 3, 3);">Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect
                it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access,
                disclosure, copying, use, or modification. </p>
            <p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no
                method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data
                security. </p>
            <p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security
                of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring you do not make your
                personal information publicly available via our platform. </p>
            <h3 style="color:rgb(141, 3, 3);">How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we
                are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have
                provided us with personal information such as an email address when contacting us about a specific
                enquiry, we may retain this information for the duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for
                our own records so we may effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information
                is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details
                that identify you. </p>
            <p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal,
